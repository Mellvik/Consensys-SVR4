What's in the images:

- `Consensys-unix-[1-3].img` - the original floppy images, 1.2MB.
- `Consensys-unix-2-mod.img` - a minor modification to the 2nd floppy to eliminate the need for a license key.
- `Consensys-unix-1-mod.img` - Booting from this images will start an interactive shell just before the install procedure is about to ask for what they call the 'Foundation set'.

The shell provides the ability to poke around in the system, but the utilities are limited and the poking not all that useful.
